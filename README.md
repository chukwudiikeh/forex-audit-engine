# 🏗️ Forex Ledger Protocol
A decentralized Forex audit engine built on Stellar/Soroban that uses on-chain data analysis to calculate trade expectancy, identify high-risk setups, and help traders improve their win rate through verifiable performance metrics.

## 🎯 Core Problem
Forex traders lack a transparent, tamper-proof way to track performance and identify patterns that hurt profitability. Manual journaling is error-prone, and centralized platforms don't provide privacy or verifiable proof of trading skill.

## 🏛️ Three-Layer Architecture

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer (Off-Chain/Oracle)
**Purpose:** Bring Forex trade data from MT4/MT5/cTrader onto the Stellar ledger.

**Implementation:**
- CLI/web interface for uploading trade history (.csv/.json)
- Hash anchoring: Each trade log's hash is stored on-chain, proving data integrity
- Prevents tampering and creates an immutable audit trail

**Key Features:**
- Support for multiple broker formats
- Automatic data validation and normalization
- Cryptographic proof of data authenticity

---

### 2. Analytical Engine (Soroban Smart Contracts)
**Purpose:** Core pattern analysis and risk detection using Rust-based contracts.

**Pattern Attribution:**
- Categorizes trades by "Setup ID" (Breakout, Mean Reversion, etc.)
- Calculates Profit Factor and Trade Expectancy per setup
- Identifies correlations between trade outcomes and market conditions

**Red Flag Detection:**
- **Time-of-Day Risk:** Detects win rate drops during specific sessions (Asian, European, US)
- **Asset Correlation:** Identifies "double-dipping" (e.g., Long EUR/USD + Short USD/CHF)
- **Revenge Trading:** Flags trades opened within 5 minutes of a loss
- **Maximum Drawdown (MDD):** Alerts when daily loss threshold is exceeded

**Key Metrics Calculated:**
- Trade Expectancy: `E = (Win% × Avg Win) - (Loss% × Avg Loss)`
- Risk-to-Reward (R:R) Efficiency
- Win Rate by Setup, Session, and Asset
- Consecutive Win/Loss Streaks

---

### 3. Insights Dashboard (Win Rate Booster)
**Purpose:** Translate on-chain analytics into actionable trader insights.

**Features:**
- **Heat Maps:** Visualize win rates across days and trading sessions
- **Anti-Journal:** Blacklisted setups based on historical underperformance
- **Performance Tokens:** View minted SBTs proving trading skill to investors
- **Setup Recommendations:** High-probability vs. low-probability trade patterns
- **Risk Alerts:** Real-time warnings for dangerous trading behaviors

## 📊 Key Analysis Metrics

### Trade Expectancy
Calculates expected profit per trade:
```
E = (Win% × Avg Win) - (Loss% × Avg Loss)
```

### Risk-to-Reward Efficiency
Identifies if traders close winners early and let losers run.

### Maximum Drawdown Protection
Contract-based alerts trigger when daily loss threshold is exceeded.

### Setup Performance
Win rate, profit factor, and expectancy broken down by:
- Trade setup type
- Trading session (Asian, European, US)
- Asset pair
- Time of day
